# Introduction

One thing people doing statistical analyses find themselves doing every so often is creating tables for descriptive summaries of data (a.k.a. Table.1), or comparative tables.

A lot of packages already address this issue, such as the aptly named *tableone* package to name one, but they either include some hard-coded behaviors, are a bit out-fashioned in their syntax (because of the incompatibility with the argument order for use with *dplyr* and the pipe (`%>%`)), or have outputs that are not easily manipulable with standard R tools.

Enter *desctable*, a package built with these objectives in mind:

  * generate descriptive and comparative statistics tables
  * keep the syntax as simple as possible
  * integrated with "modern" R usage, and the *tidyverse* set of tools
  * good reasonable defaults
  * yet entirely customizable, using standard R tools and functions
  * produce the simplest output possible, with helpers for different outputs
  * based on a functional paradigm

# Installation

```
devtools::install_github("maximewack/desctable", build_vignettes = T)
```

# Loading

```{r}
library(desctable)
```

It is recommended to read this manual through its vignette:
```{r}
vignette("desctable")
```

Pander can be loaded at any time

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(pander)
```

# Descriptive tables

## Simple usage

*desctable* uses and exports the pipe (`%>%`) operator (from packages *magrittr* and *dplyr* fame), though it is not mandatory to use it.

The most simple thing you can do with *desctable* is to create a descriptive table from a dataset:

```{r}
iris %>%
  desctable

mtcars %>%
  desctable
```

As you can see with these two examples, `desctable` describes every variable, with individual levels for factors, picks statistical functions depending on the type and distribution of the variables in the data, and applies those statistical functions on the relevant variables.

## Output

The resulting object produced by `desctable` is in fact a list of data.frames, with a "desctable" class. Methods for reduction to a simple dataframe (`as.data.frame`, automatically used for printing), conversion to markdown (`pander`), or interactive html output with DT (`datatable`) (not shown here) are provided:

```{r}
iris %>%
  desctable %>%
  pander
```
<br>
You need to load these two packages first (and prior to *desctable* for *DT*)if you want to use them.  
Calls to `pander` and `datatable` with "regular" dataframes will not be affected by the defaults used in the package.

Subsequent outputs in this vignette section will use pander. The `datatable` wrapper function for *desctable* objects comes with some default options and formatting such as freezing the row names and table header, export buttons, and rounding of values. Both `pander` and `datatable` wrapper take a **digits** argument to set the number of decimals to show.

## Advanced usage

`desctable` choses statistical functions for you using this algorithm:

  * always show N
  * if there are factors, show %
  * if there are normally distributed variables (`length > 30 && shapiro.test > .1`, provided with the `is.normal` function), show Mean and SD
  * if there are non-normally distributed variables, show Median and IQR

For each variable in the table, compute the relevant statistical functions in that list (non-applicable functions will safely return *NA*).

So, how does it work, and how can **you** adapt this behavior to your liking?

`desctable` takes an optional **stats** argument. This argument can either be:

  * an automatic function to select appropriate statistical functions
  * or a named list of
    * statistical functions
    * formulas describing conditions to use a statistical function.


### Automatic function

This is the case by default, with the `stats_auto` function provided in the package.  
You can provide your own automatic function. It needs to accept a dataframe as its argument (also whether to use this dataframe or not is your choice when defining that function!) and return a named list of statistical functions to use, as defined in the subsequent paragraphs.

Several "automatic statistical functions functions" are defined in this package: `stats_auto`, `stats_default`, `stats_normal`, `stats_nonnormal`.

```{r}
# Strictly equivalent to iris %>% desctable %>% datatable
iris %>%
  desctable(stats = stats_auto) %>%
  pander
```

### Statistical functions

Statistical functions can be any function defined in R that you want to use, such as `length` or `mean`.  
The only conditions is that they return a single numerical value for their input. (they also can, as is needed for the `percent` function to be possible, return a vector of length `1 + nlevels(fact)`).  
They need to be used inside a named list, such as

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  desctable(stats = list("N" = length, "Mean" = mean, "SD" = sd)) %>%
  pander
```
<br>

The names will be used as column headers in the resulting table, and the functions will be applied safely on the variables (errors return *NA*, and for factors the function will be used on individual levels).

Several convenience functions are included in this package. The statistical function ones are: `percent`, which prints percentages of levels in a factor, and `IQR` which re-implements `stats::IQR` but works better with *NA* values.

Be aware that **all functions are used on variables stripped of their *NA* values!** This is necessary for most statistical functions to be useful, and makes **N** (`length`) show only the number of observations in the dataset for each variable.

### Conditional formula

The general form of these formulas is

**predicate_function ~ stat_function_if_TRUE | stat_function_if_FALSE**

The *FALSE* option can be omitted and *NA* will be produced if the condition in the predicate is not met.  
These statements can be nested using parentheses.  
For example:

`is.factor ~ percent | (is.normal ~ mean)`

will either use `percent` if the variable is a factor, or `mean` if and only if the variable is normally distributed.

You can mix "bare" statistical functions and formulas in the list defining the statistics you want to use in your table.

```{r}
iris %>%
  desctable(stats = list("N"      = length,
                         "%/Mean" = is.factor ~ percent | (is.normal ~ mean),
                         "Median" = is.normal ~ NA | median)) %>%
  pander
```
<br>

Here is the body of the `stats_auto` function in the package:
```{r, echo = F}
print(body(stats_auto))
```

### Labels

It is often the case that variable names are not "pretty" enough to be used as-is in a table.  
Although you could still edit the variable labels in the table afterwards using subsetting or string replacement functions, it is possible to mention a **labels** argument.

This **labels** argument is a named character vector associating variable names and labels.  
You don't need to provide labels for all the variables, and extra labels will be silently discarded. This allows you to define a "global" labels vector and use it for every table even after variable selections.

```{r}
mtlabels <- c(mpg  = "Miles/(US) gallon",
              cyl  = "Number of cylinders",
              disp = "Displacement (cu.in.)",
              hp   = "Gross horsepower",
              drat = "Rear axle ratio",
              wt   = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
              qsec = "Â¼ mile time",
              vs   = "V/S",
              am   = "Transmission",
              gear = "Number of forward gears",
              carb = "Number of carburetors")

mtcars %>%
  dplyr::mutate(am = factor(am, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))) %>%
  desctable(labels = mtlabels) %>%
  pander
```
<br>

# Comparative tables

## Simple usage

Creating a comparative table between groups defined by a factor using `desctable` is almost as easy, and uses the well known `group_by` function from *dplyr*:

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  desctable -> iris_by_Species

iris_by_Species
```

The results is a table containing a descriptive subtable for each level of the grouping factor (the statistical functions rules are applied to each subtable independently), with the statistical tests performed and their p value.

When displayed as a flat dataframe, the group headers appear in each variable. You can also see them by inspecting the resulting object, which is a list of dataframes, each named after the grouping factor and its levels (with sample size for each).

```{r}
str(iris_by_Species)
```

In fact, you can specify groups based on any variable, not only factors:

```{r}
# With pander output
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  desctable %>%
  pander
```
Also with conditions:

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Petal.Length > 5) %>%
  desctable %>%
  pander
```
<br>

And even nested groups:

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
mtcars %>%
  dplyr::mutate(am = factor(am, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))) %>%
  group_by(vs, am, cyl) %>%
  desctable %>%
  pander
```
<br>

In the case of nested groups (aka sub-group analysis), statistical tests are performed only between the groups of the deepest grouping level.


Statistical tests are automatically picked depending on the data and the grouping factor.

## Advanced usage

`desctable` choses the statistical tests using the following algorithm:

  * if the variable is a factor, use `fisher.test`
  * if the grouping factor has only one level, use the provided `no.test` (which does nothing)
  * if the grouping factor has two levels
    * and the variable presents homoskedasticity (`bartlett.test > .1`) and normality of distribution in both groups, use `t.test`
    * else use `wilcox.test`
  * if the grouping factor has more than two levels
    * and the variable presents homoskedasticity (`bartlett.test > .1`) and normality of distribution in all groups, use `ANOVA` (a wrapper around `summary(aov(formula))`)
    * else use `kruskal.test`

But what if you have reasons, or need to pick a specific test for a specific variable, or change all the tests altogether?

`desctable` takes an optional **tests** argument. This argument can either be

  * an automatic function to select appropriate statistical test functions
  * or a named list of statistical test functions

### Automatic function

This is the case by default, with the `tests_auto` function provided in the package.  
You can provide your own automatic function. It needs to accept a variable and a grouping factor as its arguments and return a single-term formula containing a statistical test function.  
This function will be used on every variable and every grouping factor to determine the appropriate test.

```{r}
# Strictly equivalent to iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% desctable %>% pander
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  desctable(tests = tests_auto) %>%
  pander
```
<br>

### List of statistical test functions

You can provide a named list of statistical functions, but here the mechanism is a bit different from the **stats** argument.

The list must contain exactly one of `.auto` or `.default`.  
`.auto` needs to be an automatic function, such as `tests_auto`. It will be used by default on all variables to select a test.  
`.default` needs to be a single-term formula containing a statistical test function that will be used on all variables.

You can also provide overrides to use specific tests for specific variables.  
This is done using list items named as the variable and containing a single-term formula function.

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Petal.Length > 5) %>%
  desctable(tests = list(.auto   = tests_auto,
                         Species = ~chisq.test)) %>%
  pander
```
<br>

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  dplyr::mutate(am = factor(am, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))) %>%
  group_by(am) %>%
  desctable(tests = list(.default = ~wilcox.test,
                         mpg      = ~t.test)) %>%
  pander
```
<br>

You might wonder why the formula expression. That is needed to capture the test name, to be able to provide it in the resulting table.

As with statistical functions, any statistical test function defined is R can be used.  
The conditions is that the function accepts a formula (`variable ~ grouping_variable`) as a first positional argument (as is the case with most tests, like `t.test`), and returns an object with a `$p.value` element.

Several convenience function are provided: formula versions of `chisq.test` and `fisher.test` are provided using generic S3 methods (thus the behavior of standard calls to `chisq.test` and `fisher.test` are not modified), and `ANOVA`, a partial application of `oneway.test(var.equal = T)`.

# Tips and tricks

In the **stats** argument, you can not only provide function names, but even arbitrary function definitions, functional sequences, or partial applications:

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  desctable(stats = list("N"              = length,
                         "Sum of squares" = function(x) sum(x^2),
                         "Q1"             = . %>% quantile(prob = .25),
                         "Q3"             = purrr::partial(quantile, probs = .75))) %>%
  pander
```
<br>

In the **tests** arguments, you can also provide function definitions, functional sequences, and partial applications in the formulas:
```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  desctable(tests = list(.auto = tests_auto,
                         Sepal.Width = ~function(f) oneway.test(f, var.equal = F),
                         Petal.Length = ~. %>% oneway.test(var.equal = T),
                         Sepal.Length = ~purrr::partial(oneway.test, var.equal = T))) %>%
  pander
```
<br>

This allows you to modulate the behavior of `desctable` in every detail, such as using paired tests, or non *htest* tests.
```{r}
# This is a contrived example, which would be better solved with a dedicated function
library(survival)

bladder$surv <- Surv(bladder$stop, bladder$event)

bladder %>%
  group_by(rx) %>%
  desctable(tests = list(.default = ~wilcox.test,
                         surv = ~. %>% survdiff %>% .$chisq %>% pchisq(1, lower.tail = F) %>% list(p.value = .))) %>%
  pander
```
