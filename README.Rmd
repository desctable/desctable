**Warning to existing users**  
*This version introduces a new API that should make the creation of tables more flexible.  
The old API is still present but in a deprecated mode.  
See the roadmap below, and the website for the new usage.  
Suggestions about this change are welcome !*

# Introduction

Desctable aims to be a simple and expressive interface to building statistical tables in R.

See [desctable.github.io](https://desctable.github.io) for usage ond documentation.

# Installation

Install from CRAN (0.1.9) with

```
install.packages("desctable")
```

or install the development version (0.3) from github with

```
devtools::install_github("desctable/desctable")
```

# Roadmap

## 0.3

This new version introduces a new internal representation as well as an entirely new API for desctable !  
The original `desctable` function and usage remains until 1.0, but begins deprecation.

This new API is more flexible and more simple at the same time. Combine `group_by`, `desc_table`, `desc_tests`, and `desc_output` to create descriptive and comparative statistics tables and output them to various formats.

The internal representation is now a simple dataframe in the simple descriptive case, and a nested dataframe with list-columns for comparative tables, allowing easier manipulation by the user.

## Next

- Add a `desc_output` for {gt}
- Implement a way to make tables for survival analysis.
- Implement a way to make tables for multivariate models.
- Allow univariate tests for simple tables
- add a column for totals in grouped tables
